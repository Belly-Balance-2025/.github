<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Does Belly Balance Work?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Belly Balance is very rich in fiber, which helps cleanse out the colon for improved digestive health. This leads to healthier, more regular bowel movements and relief from unpleasant symptoms like bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A research review published in Cell Host &amp; Microbe by Kassem Makki, et al examined the role of dietary fiber on the gut microbiota and its impact on health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fiber also offers other benefits like supporting heart health, lowering blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and suppressing hunger and cravings so you consume fewer daily calories. Over time, this could lead to weight loss benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to an article by Diane Quagliani, in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medication:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>"Adequate intake of dietary fiber is associated with digestive health and reduced risk for heart disease, stroke, hypertension, certain gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers ."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Belly Balance has probiotics, which are good bacteria that live in the intestines. The prebiotic fiber in this formula feeds the probiotics so they can proliferate, killing harmful microbes and balancing the gut microbiota for improved overall digestive health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A review of the research published by Yu-Ling Tsai, et al in the Journal of Biomedical Science discussed the role of prebiotics and probiotics in treating disease .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Belly Balance formula is high in anti-inflammatory properties which help decrease swelling in the gut and other organs like the heart, liver, pancreas, and brain. It's full of rich free-radical abolishing antioxidants which lower oxidative stress in the body for general repair and immune system support.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Claimed Benefits:</h2>
<p>The biggest benefit of Belly Balance is to help you improve your digestion, but there are several other benefits you can get with the regular use of this supplement. However, it is not designed like you can use it for a few days and then put it into your medicine cabinet. You must use Belly Balance regularly to ensure your digestive system keeps working properly, and you can use it intermittently whenever you feel any digestion problems.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits you can expect by regularly using the Belly Balance supplement:</p>
<h3>Help Relieve Constipation:</h3>
<p>Constipation can occur due to several reasons. Some people have slow digestion to the level where removing harmful toxins from the body becomes impossible. Dehydration is another reason for slowing down the process of elimination. Lack of fiber intake can also reduce bowel movements. Belly Balance contains plant-based ingredients to increase fiber intake and speed up the process of removing toxins.</p>
<h3>Help Reduce Bloating:</h3>
<p>Bloating is a common condition in which the body feels tight and full, probably due to gas. When you start using two Belly Balance capsules regularly, you&rsquo;ll notice fewer problems with gas and bloating. When the occurrences of gas and bloating goes down, you will feel energetic and active.</p>
<h3>Help With Weight Loss:</h3>
<p>The creator, Samuel Bart, doesn&rsquo;t claim anywhere on the official website that Belly Balance can help with weight loss. However, some customers notice a drop in a few pounds after using this supplement. The concept behind this benefit is linked to the presence of psyllium husk and other high-fiber ingredients that can keep you fuller for a longer period, thus helping you to eat fewer calories.&nbsp;</p>
